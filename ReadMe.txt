This is a standalone recipe management application implemented in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. It allows users to enter, view, and filter recipes based on ingredients, food groups, and maximum calories. Users can also create a menu by selecting multiple recipes and view a pie chart showing the percentage of each food group in the menu.

## Changes Based on Feedback

Based on the feedback from our lecturer, the following changes have been made to the application:

1. Updated the user interface to use Windows Forms for a more user-friendly experience.
2. Added filtering functionality to allow users to filter the recipe list by ingredient, food group, or maximum calories.
3. Implemented the ability to select multiple recipes and display a pie chart showing the percentage of each food group in the menu.
4. Refactored the code to use generic collections instead of arrays for storing recipes, ingredients, and steps.
5. Added unit tests to test the total calorie calculation.

These changes aim to improve the user experience, provide more flexibility in filtering recipes, and ensure the accuracy of the calorie calculations through testing.
